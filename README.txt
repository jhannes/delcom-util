This is a Ruby library that makes it easier to control
a Delcom USB controlled Visual Indicator (LED lamp).

The lamp can be purchased from http://www.delcomproducts.com/Default.asp.

In order to use these scripts, DelcommDLL.dll must be in the
same directory as the script. This can be downloaded from
http://www.delcomproducts.com/ShowLinks.asp?Type=SOFTWARE

Happy hacking!
